128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Follow up: Could you implement the O(n) solution? 


Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

# Method 1
O(n): every data point can be acceseed within constant number of times
Think about how you "find" a sequence: n, n+1, n+2, n+3, ...
how do you "find" this sequence only "once" ? (no subsequece)
make sure when you are "finding" it, you are starting at the right start

So if x-1 exists, x is not a right start to find the sequence starting with it

in this way, every point is accessed at most twice (one iteration, on in constructing sequence)

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() == 0) return 0;
        unordered_set<int> nums_set(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        int max_length = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i<nums.size(); i++){
            if (nums_set.find(nums[i]-1) == nums_set.end()){
                int cur_length = 1;
                int cur_val = nums[i];
                while (nums_set.find(cur_val+1) != nums_set.end()){
                    cur_length += 1;
                    cur_val += 1;
                }
                max_length = cur_length > max_length ? cur_length : max_length;
            } 
        }
        return max_length;
    }
};
```

# Method 2: quite abstract!
Although abstract it starts quite intuitively
maintain a list of sequences
when you add a new number, looking at exisitng sequences

A hash table: key is a number, value is the length of the sequence that it is currently in
when you insert a value, see if you can update a sequence, or combine a sequence
and then, update the values in hash table

how to minimize complexity?
you dont need to update all values in the sequence!
only the terminal of the sequence

when you face a point, say you find a sequence just left to it.
You access length at the rightmost int of the sequence, and then you find the leftmost int, then you can update leftmost points, so that next time you access to this sequence, you have the correct length at the leftmost int

there are three points that can be a terminal: current int, leftmost of left sequnce, rightmost of right sequence

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() == 0) return 0;
        unordered_map<int,int> mp;
        int max_len = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size();i++){
            int cur_val = nums[i];
            if (mp[cur_val] > 0) continue;
            int l = mp[cur_val - 1]; //default value is 0. Check on more default value of STL
            int r = mp[cur_val + 1];
            int cur_len = l+r+1;

            mp[cur_val]   = cur_len;
            mp[cur_val-l] = cur_len;
            mp[cur_val+r] = cur_len;

            max_len = cur_len > max_len ? cur_len : max_len;
        }

        return max_len;
    }
};
```
